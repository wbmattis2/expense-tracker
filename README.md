# Expense Tracker

Expense tracker app built with PHP and MySQL by Benny Mattis.  

App built to specifications provided in a course at Montgomery College.

## Purpose

To allow users to record and report on expenses in customizable categories.

## How to Use

Use MAMP or XAMP to download PHP on your computer, put the php-exercises folder in the htdocs directory, and navigate to it in your web browser on localhost while the server is running. Be sure to change assets/php/_db_config.php according to your MySQL database credentials.  

When the site is running, enter new credentials to create an account. Enter them again to log in to the new account.  

## Features

Specifications.txt describes the function of each file in the application.  

When logging in, click the checkbox to allow the app to "remember you" with a 24-hour cookie.

When viewing an expense report, click the button below the expense report to download it in CSV format.  

Each account has its own custom categories. Create a new category by entering its name while viewing categories or while entering an expense.

While entering an expense, select a store that has already been used in the database, or enter a new store name to add the new store to the database.
